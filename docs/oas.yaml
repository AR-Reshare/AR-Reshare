  # !!! one for a password reset? -- ANSWER: The above handled all account modification. The client will send the new information to overwrite and they use their password and token to validate their request
  ## This overwrite can include a new password
  #NOTE: I've deleted single-variable modification paths into a generic path that handles all modification
