### Secrets Folder

This folder is a place to store the private-keys, api-keys and configs which contain those.

The sensitive information required by our application is listed below:

- JWT Encryption Key
  - Our current token-based auth uses symmetric key encryption--> Therefore there is only one key
- DB Connection Config (incl. password)
  - Our current implementation uses a randomly generated 32 byte string password
- Email Respond (Transactional Email)
  - Our current implementation sends SMTP email requests to SendGrid --> Configuration file that includes api-key
- Push Notifications (FCM-Messaging)
  - This requires us to have a Service Account SDK to authorize requests to the FCM backend service - Configuration file that includes api-key
  - NOTE: There exists a google-services.json that can be downloaded -- however this is for the Android client, not for our backend-service
- Media Handler (Cloudinary)
  - This requires an API Key in order to interact with the Cloudinary backend service
