// There are certain events which require the application to send an email, which can include:
// 1. Account Creation
// 2. Password Reset
// 3. Account Detail Modification

// To implement this module, we need to:
// 1. create the "templates" that we can use to send these emails
// 2. provide the logic to perform the email sending operations
// 3. integrate this functionality with the above operations (account-creation, password-reset, account-modification)
